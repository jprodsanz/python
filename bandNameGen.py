# In this exercise I created a band name generator

print("Hi, you are tuned to DAWN FM, the middle of nowhere on your dial. You might be here a while...")

# By Creating a VAR we will have access to what the user types in
city = input("What city are you from?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

print("Your band name could be:" " " + city + " " + pet)
